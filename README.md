Flood Detection System — Explanation [ GROUP 20 PROJECT]

Our flood detection system is a web-based, real-time monitoring platform designed to help the public and Malawi’s Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA) understand and respond to flood risks early. The system combines geospatial data, weather data, and AI assistance to provide accurate and accessible flood risk insights.
