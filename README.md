Flood Detection System — Explanation [ GROUP 20 PROJECT]

Our flood detection system is a web-based, real-time monitoring platform designed to help the public and Malawi’s Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA) understand and respond to flood risks early. The system combines geospatial data, weather data, and AI assistance to provide accurate and accessible flood risk insights.

1. Purpose of the System

Flooding remains one of Malawi’s most frequent natural disasters, affecting communities, infrastructure, agriculture, and public safety. Many areas lack early warning tools that are accessible and easy to interpret.

Our system aims to:

Provide early flood warnings to reduce loss of life and property

Help DoDMA monitor high-risk districts and Traditional Authorities (TAs)

Support community preparedness with reliable information

Enable informed decision-making for evacuation, resource allocation, and emergency response

Visualize flood-prone areas and hazard zones on an interactive map

2. Key Components of the System
a) Geospatial (GIS) Data Layer

The system integrates multiple spatial layers such as:

Districts and Traditional Authorities (TA/TA3 boundries)

Rivers, streams, and major water bodies

Roads, bridges, and critical infrastructure

Flood-prone zones and hazard classification maps

Elevation and slope-derived risk factors

These layers help visualize which areas are most vulnerable and how floods may spread.

b) Real-Time Weather & Hydrological Data

The platform fetches:

Rainfall estimates (RFE)

River water levels

Soil moisture

Storm forecasts and alerts

Rainstorm intensity and duration

This information is used to assess ongoing flood risk and predict potential overflow.

c) AI-Assisted Flood Risk Analysis

The system uses simple but effective AI-assisted logic to:

Detect unusual patterns in rainfall

Estimate probability of flooding

Identify hotspots based on multiple indicators

Provide risk levels (Low, Medium, High, Severe)

Explain risk in simple, understandable language

AI is used to support both public understanding and official response.

d) Interactive Map & Search Tool

Users can interact with a dynamic map that allows them to:

Search any district, TA, or location

View flood risk level for the selected area

See rivers, roads, and hazards around them

Zoom into specific villages/communities

Visualize real-time rainfall and water level changes

The map provides both visual interpretation and text-based summaries.

3. How the System Works

The backend collects geospatial and weather data from reliable sources.

Data is processed and analyzed to identify risk patterns.

The frontend map displays district and TA boundaries with risk scores.

When a user searches a location, the system returns:

Flood risk score

Reasons for the risk

Relevant nearby rivers or warning zones

Alerts are generated when indicators pass thresholds.

4. Beneficiaries
a) Government (DoDMA)

Better disaster planning

Quick identification of high-risk zones

Improved response time

Enhanced resource allocation and rescue planning

b) General Public

Early warning before floods occur

Better understanding of local risk

Access to trustworthy, actionable information

Improved community readiness

c) NGOs & Emergency Agencies

Data to support humanitarian interventions

Up-to-date flood hazard information

Clear visuals for decision-making

5. Unique Features of Our System

Web-based (accessible on any device)

Interactive GIS mapping

Real-time weather integration

AI-assisted flood explanation

User-friendly search and location detection

Risk scoring and hazard classification

Supports local languages (if added)

6. Conclusion

The Flood Detection System by Group 20 represents a modern approach to flood disaster management in Malawi. By combining GIS, real-time monitoring, and AI analysis, the system enhances awareness, preparedness, and response to flood risks. Ultimately, the project aims to save lives, protect property, and support government agencies with accurate, timely, and accessible flood information.
